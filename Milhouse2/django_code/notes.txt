# Some notes on DB model and implementation

## MongoDB Implementation
 - User creates, uploads and submits project definition CSV
 - csv2job converts CSV to secondary job objects
 - csv and secondary jobs are fed into process that generates condition objects
 - analysis profiles selected populate plots and tables in project
 - secondary jobs are submitted
 - milhouse pings secondary analysis servers for status updates on jobs
 - once analysis completes, milhouse runs split and merge operations on cmpH5s
 - milhouse runs the analysis procedures and waits for the plots to populate
 - placeholders are replaced with the actual plots upon web service receipt of plot
